        Let's be honest. Websites are cool and everyone should have one! But as soon as we try to actually keep it up to date or would want something more than two images and self written poem on it we quickly realize that keeping things together would become a massive pain in the bottom if we stuck to plain HTML/CSS. The next step follows and we dive into Javascript, PHP and databases. But it seems rather strange that I should use and maintain a huge database that can power whole enterprises to put some pictures in a gallery or from time to time drop a blog post.

        Additionally it is hard to dive into a CMS or something of the like if we really want something personal, simple and clean. You find yourself striving through configuration files and theme files until you come as close to your resulst as you want. This is often hard or impossible since most CMS include a lot of plugins and features that often just get in the way of a fast and manageable developing experience. One never actually knows what goes on under the hood of the own god damn website which is a shame.

        Moreover we all already know our fair share of HTML and CSS! Why shouldn't this be enough to get as far as we want? We don't want any logins, databases, interactive server connections and we sure as hell don't want to show ads or trace cookies! We don't need PHP to create the page on the server every time we have a visitor that looks at our blog.  We want to present ourselves, out work and our passions nothing more, nothing less.

        This is where RubySow steps in. It enables you to further split up HTML documents into parseable flat files that are eventually sowed together into one webpage. This means you can tell RubySow which content should appear where and how in a flexible and transparent way. Almost all of the HTML code has to be written by you! This is not a short coming - it's the feature! But you can declare variables, lists and even trees that can be converted into plain HTML the way you want. Everything is under your control. RubySow just enables you to manage your web project the way you want and steps in whenever handwriting normal web code would become tedious or one would reach for PHP and Javascript.

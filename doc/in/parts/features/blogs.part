<h4>Create and manage blogs</h4>
<p>
Many of us want to share texts, images and anything concerning their thoughts in an easy but still flexible manner. Once styled and configured everything should always work as expected. But we all want to change something from time to time. A short configuration file allows simple and fast refactoring of the blog without losing any posts. An archive can be generated as needed and every post may get an own page. Moreover the whole blog can be split into several pages.
